# 001 - The Last Orbit

[GitHub link](https://github.com/harmanxgill/event-horizon-studio/tree/main/pieces/001_last_orbit "https://github.com/harmanxgill/event-horizon-studio/tree/main/pieces/001_last_orbit")

## Concept

Two equal-mass black holes in the last orbit before merger. This is art from equations, not a physics simulation.

## Mathematical Construction

The coordinate plane is normalized around the binary center of mass. With orbital phase `phi` and separation `d`, the centers are

```text
c1 = -(d / 2) (cos(phi), sin(phi))
c2 =  (d / 2) (cos(phi), sin(phi))
```

For each image coordinate `(x, y)`, the base fields are

```text
r1 = sqrt((x - c1x)^2 + (y - c1y)^2)
r2 = sqrt((x - c2x)^2 + (y - c2y)^2)

theta1 = atan2(y - c1y, x - c1x)
theta2 = atan2(y - c2y, x - c2x)
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `width`, `height` | Number of sampled pixels in the rendered grid. |
| `extent` | Half-width of the mathematical coordinate plane. |
| `separation` | Distance between the two equal-mass centers. |
| `orbit_phase` | Rotation angle of the binary axis in radians. |
| `horizon_radius` | Radius used for each horizon field. |
| `horizon_edge` | Softness of the logistic horizon boundary. |
| `softening` | Small radial term used to keep future inverse fields finite. |

## Rendering

From the repository root:

```bash
python pieces/001_last_orbit/render.py --width 1200 --height 1200
```

The default output path is `pieces/001_last_orbit/output/last_orbit_preview.png`.

## Experiments

### v001 - two radial fields

The first experiment:

```text
F(x, y) = exp(-80(r1 - 0.25)^2) + exp(-80(r2 - 0.25)^2)
```

The RGB image comes directly from `F`.

Render it with:

```bash
python pieces/001_last_orbit/experiments/v001_two_radial_fields.py
```

### v002 - horizon masks

The same two rings, with an event horizon carved out of each center. With the
logistic horizon field

```text
H(r) = 1 / (1 + exp((r - r_h) / w))
S(x, y) = max(H(r1), H(r2))
```

the image becomes

```text
G(x, y) = F(x, y) (1 - S(x, y))
```

`S` is close to `1` inside either horizon and close to `0` outside it, so `G`
matches `F` away from the centers and falls to zero within `r_h`. The horizon
radius `r_h = 0.14` and edge width `w = 0.015` are the same values
`equations.py` uses, so the experiment and the piece agree.

Render it with:

```bash
python pieces/001_last_orbit/experiments/v002_horizon_masks.py
```

Possible next versions:

- v003: angular dependence
- v004: disk distortion toward the companion
